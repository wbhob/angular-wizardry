# Angular Wizardry for AngularJS Folks

This repo contains the talk for Wilson Hobbs's talk on the differences between AngularJS and Angular. The apps are essentially the same, with the exception that the one contained in the `angularjs` folder is written in AngularJS (Angular 1), while the one contained in `angular` is written in Angular (Angular 4).

### Running AngularJS project
Jump into the `angularjs` directory and run these commands:
1. `npm install`
1. `bower install` (or `bower update`)
1. `npm start`

### Running the Angular Project
Jump into the `angular` directory and run these commands:
1. `npm install -g @angular/cli`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`
